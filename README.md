# Co-ordinate-Extraction

  We all know that the best way to locate a place on the map is to locate them with the help to co-ordinates(latitude and longitude). So with the help of my friend and classmate Ishan Sethi(https://github.com/IshanSethi9) I created a code that takes all the location entered into a excel sheet as an input and extracts the coordinates of these places and then store them in a CSV format also providing a url to check it on the browser. I did this with the help of Pandas and Selenium library in python.
